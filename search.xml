    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="Forex-Wiki-Green-EA-Introduction"><a href="#Forex-Wiki-Green-EA-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Forex Wiki Green EA Introduction"></a>Forex Wiki Green EA Introduction</h2><p>Greetings,</p>
<p>As a team of Forex traders with over a decade of experience, we understand the challenges that come with trading in the foreign exchange market. We have been closely monitoring the software marketing trends for more than ten years, and every time we come across a new Forex tool, we try to share it with our Forex Wiki friends to help them understand how it works.</p>
<p>In our development lab, we have conducted in-depth analyses of hundreds of strategies. Thanks to our site’s administrator, who is a Doctor of Artificial Intelligence, we have been able to achieve incredible results in our development work. We have achieved a 91% precision rate in detecting entry points, which is a significant breakthrough.</p>
<p>However, the challenge in Forex trading is not just about determining entry points. Sometimes, the market moves quickly and can reverse the trend, making it challenging to determine the Take Profit (TP) and Stop Loss (SL) levels in static values.</p>
<p>That’s where our innovative idea of using martingale management based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) comes in. We have developed a complex training system to manage orders using a unique martingale method that does not rely only on multiplication, unlike the old method. Instead, our system is trained with over 100 real parameters taken from the real market to manage the martingale process.</p>
<p>Our martingale management system based on AI is a game-changer in Forex trading. It helps us to manage orders effectively and reduce the risks associated with traditional martingale methods. With this system, we can achieve better results in our trading strategies and increase our profits.</p>
<p>If you want to take your Forex trading to the next level, we recommend that you try our martingale management system based on AI. Contact us today to learn more about how this system can help you achieve your Forex trading goals.</p>
<h2 id="Forex-Wiki-Green-EA-Review"><a href="#Forex-Wiki-Green-EA-Review" class="headerlink" title="Forex Wiki Green EA Review"></a>Forex Wiki Green EA Review</h2><p>Forex Wiki Green EA is a fully automatic trend-follower martingale trading system designed specifically for the EURUSD currency pair with the Time Frame H1.</p>
<p>It uses a complex and advanced martingale strategy, which involves increasing the lot size after a loss to recover losses and make a profit. While this strategy can lead to large drawdowns, the EA has been successful in generating consistent profits over time.</p>

<h2 id="Best-Brokers-List"><a href="#Best-Brokers-List" class="headerlink" title="Best Brokers List"></a><del>Best Brokers List</del></h2><h2 id="Forex-Wiki-Green-EA-Strategy"><a href="#Forex-Wiki-Green-EA-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Forex Wiki Green EA Strategy"></a>Forex Wiki Green EA Strategy</h2><p>The EA’s strategy involves placing orders according to the  direction of the market trend and only placing orders after a price correction has occurred. If the price correction is against the market trend, the EA will implement the martingale strategy to accelerate reaching the profit target.</p>
<p>In the event that the existing order has not reached the profit target and the market trend has changed, the EA will hedge as a safety measure to protect the funds. The EA will close all orders when the profit target is reached for both buy and sell orders. Additionally, if all active orders have recorded a loss of up to 5% of equity, all orders will be closed to ensure the safety of funds. The EA will then look for new opportunities and orders at the next available opportunity.</p>
<h2 id="Forex-Wiki-Green-EA-Setting"><a href="#Forex-Wiki-Green-EA-Setting" class="headerlink" title="Forex Wiki Green EA Setting"></a>Forex Wiki Green EA Setting</h2><p><strong>The EA includes various settings and parameters for lot size, risk, profit targets, and hidden stop loss, as well as buttons for closing orders and filter trades.</strong></p>

<p>One of the unique features of Forex Wiki Green EA is the inclusion of more than 10 indicators inside, which are commonly used in technical analysis to identify trends and support&#x2F;resistance levels.</p>
<p>These indicators enable the EA to follow the market trend and identify opportunities for profitable trades.</p>
<p>The EA places an order according to the direction of the market trend and places additional positions on floating negative conditions to accelerate reaching the profit target. If the profit target has not been reached and the market trend has changed, the EA will start opening trades in the opposite direction and will close all trades when the profit target has been reached.</p>
