    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Prerequisite"><a href="#Prerequisite" class="headerlink" title="Prerequisite"></a>Prerequisite</h1><p>There are a large number of projects in the cryptocurrency circle, a large number of trading pairs, but carefully think about it, how many of them are really valuable?BTC, ETH, especially ETH, have real application scenarios, and for most of the trading pairs, in fact, they are worthless, so for their trading, I will not be trading in the name of value investment, but purely gaming. But as an independent trader with a small amount of capital, we will face a great deal of risk, some junk coins, immobile, soaring hundreds of points, plummeting hundreds of points, so the most important thing is to deal with the risks faced in trading, and declare war on the dog bank (refers to the institutions or people who can dog around the ups and downs)!</p>
<h1 id="Choosing-what-to-trade"><a href="#Choosing-what-to-trade" class="headerlink" title="Choosing what to trade"></a>Choosing what to trade</h1><p>My thought process is as follows:<br>Small funds follow the idea below to make your selection:</p>
<ol>
<li>Entry in the bull market: bear market capital growth is slow, and the bear market time is long, the entry point is difficult to find, the shock market is easy for you to stop loss</li>
<li>choose the new issue of the trading pair: new species generally will not break the issue, usually with the bull market, relying on the market sentiment to follow the surge, which is the easiest way to let the funds grow, doubling is very simple, of course, as long as it is a transaction, there is certainly a risk, so we need to liquidate the game!</li>
<li>bull market to choose junk coins, liquidation of long-term short: Whenever the bull market market, a large number of junk coins will soar, such as a few dollars to dozens of dollars, for this kind of coins, we can be its long-term short, there will always be a time, it will return to the value of the choice of coins, you need to understand the background, to confirm that its nature really does not have any value, it is a purely financial game. At this point, we are shorting at a high level, of course, they may continue to soar, but to believe that his growth space is not much, so here we must be light leverage, must not be heavy positions, remain patient!</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>A large amount of money can follow the following ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>the basic idea and the above consistent</li>
<li>Bear market buy value coins: buy BTC, ETH, etc. at a cheap price</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Be sure to have your own thinking about each currency and the meaning behind its growth</p>
<p><strong>Fighting Financial Institutions to the End</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h1 id="Some-examples"><a href="#Some-examples" class="headerlink" title="Some examples"></a>Some examples</h1><ul>
<li><strong>people</strong>:Organizations are disbanded and so fragile? But whenever there’s a US presidential election, there’s always a ticker, it’s just taking its name and hyping it up.</li>
<li><strong>ORDI</strong>:The first token created using the BRC-20 replaceable token standard, so what? Can’t do it without you? What’s your advantage? What do you have that other tokens don’t?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been short from 84usdt and plan to hold until 25usdt then close the position</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>TURBO</strong>:This one is even funnier, with a GPT-4 challenge: create meme tokens with a budget of only $69. Tell me, what’s the point? Are you worth hundreds of millions of dollars in market cap right now with $69? It’s just pure money gaming, and in the end it’s all about harvesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>……..</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>There are so many examples that you need to explore on your own, however, when making trades, it is important to control risk, remain patient, and most importantly, be patient, and match patience with the funding agencies.</strong></p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today is June 14, 2024 and btc has been consolidating in this position for a long time now and has now come to a key position:</p>
<p><img src="/data/share/BTC2024-06-14_13-33-13.png" alt="BTC2024-06-14_13-33-13"></p>
<p>The previous decline, driving other coins down, this wave basically ate it up, the recent earnings chart below, of course, at the time of posting this article, I have all liquidated my position:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you need to register for a trading account, you can download the okx app and scan the QR code in the image above for an invitation to register, with benefits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Continue to analyze the market, the current BTC position is very critical, has broken through the previous highs, but further rises appear pressure consolidation, the current retracement to the daily key position, almost in 66260 or so, you can look at the top of the chart, the hourly line is already a downtrend, but the 4-hour k line has repeatedly support, the 50 SMA has not yet penetrated the 150 SMA, and is now very close to the reference to the past! experience, I think this BTC high is definitely more than 72000, should still be short of the last wave of the big pull up, there is an old Chinese saying: a drum, and then decline, and three and exhaustion. It’s not at the top yet!<br><strong>The market could be coming up just recently, all it takes is a very long positive line</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>So, in response to the current judgment, I plan to operate as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>look for currencies with large current retracements</li>
<li>Lay out a low position to go long</li>
<li>pay attention to the BTC support level, once broken, immediately stop loss</li>
<li>BTC appeared big positive line, break through the pressure, immediately long position</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Forex-Wiki-Green-EA-Review"><a href="#Forex-Wiki-Green-EA-Review" class="headerlink" title="Forex Wiki Green EA Review"></a>Forex Wiki Green EA Review</h2><p>The Forex Wiki Green EA is an autonomous, trend-following trading system that is tailored for the EURUSD currency pair, operating within the H1 Time Frame.</p>
<p>This system is underpinned by a sophisticated and advanced martingale approach, which entails escalating the trade size subsequent to a loss, with the aim of recouping the losses and securing a profit. Although this tactic has the potential to result in substantial drawdowns, the EA has demonstrated its capability to yield reliable profits over an extended period.</p>
<h3 id="Technical-Specifications"><a href="#Technical-Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Technical Specifications"></a>Technical Specifications</h3><ul>
<li>**Version: **1.36</li>
<li><strong>Year of issue: 2024</strong></li>
<li><strong>Working pairs: EURUSD</strong></li>
<li><strong>Recommended timeframe: H1</strong></li>
<li><strong>Minimum Deposit: !</strong></li>
<li><strong>Average of account: 1:30 To 1:1000</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In order to use this EA, a minimum balance of $3000 is required for leverage 1:500, $4000 for leverage 1:200, and $5000 for leverage 1:100.</strong></p>
<h2 id="Best-Brokers-List"><a href="#Best-Brokers-List" class="headerlink" title="Best Brokers List"></a><del>Best Brokers List</del></h2><h2 id="Forex-Wiki-Green-EA-Strategy"><a href="#Forex-Wiki-Green-EA-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Forex Wiki Green EA Strategy"></a>Forex Wiki Green EA Strategy</h2><p>The EA deploys a strategy that places trades in alignment with the prevailing market trend, initiating orders only after a price correction has taken place. Should the price correction move counter to the market trend, the EA will activate its martingale strategy to expedite the attainment of the profit target.</p>
<p>Should the situation arise where an existing order has not achieved the profit target and there is a shift in the market trend, the EA will engage in hedging as a precautionary measure to safeguard the investment. Upon reaching the profit target for both purchase and sale orders, the EA will terminate all orders. Moreover, if all active orders incur a loss reaching up to 5% of the equity, the EA will close all orders to ensure the preservation of funds. Subsequently, the EA will seek out new opportunities and execute orders at the next feasible juncture.</p>
<h2 id="Forex-Wiki-Green-EA-Setting"><a href="#Forex-Wiki-Green-EA-Setting" class="headerlink" title="Forex Wiki Green EA Setting"></a>Forex Wiki Green EA Setting</h2><p><strong>The EA includes various settings and parameters for lot size, risk, profit targets, and hidden stop loss, as well as buttons for closing orders and filter trades.</strong></p>
<p><img src="/data/ForexWikiGreenEA/setting.png" alt="setting"></p>
<p>One of the unique features of Forex Wiki Green EA is the inclusion of more than 10 indicators inside, which are commonly used in technical analysis to identify trends and support&#x2F;resistance levels.</p>
<p>These indicators enable the EA to follow the market trend and identify opportunities for profitable trades.</p>
<p>The EA places an order according to the direction of the market trend and places additional positions on floating negative conditions to accelerate reaching the profit target. If the profit target has not been reached and the market trend has changed, the EA will start opening trades in the opposite direction and will close all trades when the profit target has been reached.</p>
<h2 id="Forex-Wiki-Green-EA-Results"><a href="#Forex-Wiki-Green-EA-Results" class="headerlink" title="Forex Wiki Green EA Results"></a>Forex Wiki Green EA Results</h2><p>The training dataset used to develop this EA contains only historical data of the EURUSD pair.</p>

This advisor was developed by Rp4000 and has been provided to us for use.</p>
<p>Guidance for using the MT5 Scalping EA:</p>
<ul>
<li>A minimum account balance of $100 is necessary.</li>
<li>The EA is preset to operate on the H1 Timeframe with the EURUSD Currency Pair by default.</li>
<li>It is adaptable and can be used with any currency pair and timeframe.</li>
</ul>

<p>This superior scalping EA for the MT5 platform is noteworthy for its ability to generate profits even with minimal initial investments and maintains a low maximum drawdown during trading. It refrains from utilizing high-risk trading tactics such as grid or martingale systems, ensuring that all trades are safeguarded by take profit and stop loss orders.</p>
<p>The EA offers flexibility in trading size, either through a fixed lot size or an automatic lot size adjustment that increases the trade volume dynamically. It is capable of remaining inactive for extended periods, engaging in only 2 to 5 transactions per week, and it operates by executing a single trade at a time in the market.</p>
<p>The RoyalPrince Scalper EA has demonstrated resilience through a series of rigorous monthly stress tests, showing an outstanding profit-to-drawdown ratio. It has also been thoroughly backtested using extensive historical data, which has validated its low maximum drawdown percentage. This feature makes it viable for use with a modest initial capital outlay.</p>
<p>While the EA’s default settings target a conservative monthly profit margin of approximately 4-8%, these settings ensure a stable return with minimal drawdown.</p>

These RFIs are essential regions where notable market transactions take place, thus impacting subsequent trading choices.</strong></p>

<li><strong>Automatic Triggers and Notifications</strong>: The indicator comes with automatic activation of certain templates like RETEST and BROKEN, which initiate alerts to encourage prompt responses. This functionality simplifies the trading workflow by minimizing the need for manual oversight.</li>
