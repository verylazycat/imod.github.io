We have crafted an advanced training system that employs a novel martingale technique, diverging from the traditional method that solely relies on multiplication. Our system is refined with over 100 real-world parameters derived directly from the market to adeptly handle the martingale process.</p><p>Our AI-driven martingale management system is a revolutionary tool in the Forex trading landscape. It facilitates efficient order management and mitigates the risks inherent in conventional martingale strategies.

Although this tactic has the potential to result in substantial drawdowns, the EA has demonstrated its capability to yield reliable profits over an extended period.</p><h3 id="Technical-Specifications"><a href="#Technical-Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Technical Specifications"></a>Technical Specifications</h3><ul><li>**Version: **1.36</li><li><strong>Year of issue: 2024</strong></li><li><strong>Working pairs: EURUSD</strong></li><li><strong>Recommended timeframe: H1</strong></li><li><strong>Minimum Deposit: !</strong></li><li><strong>Average of account: 1:30 To 1:1000</strong></li></ul><p><strong>In order to use this EA, a minimum balance of $3000 is required for leverage 1:500, $4000 for leverage 1:200, and $5000 for leverage 1:100.</strong></p><h2 id="Best-Brokers-List"><a href="#Best-Brokers-List" class="headerlink" title="Best Brokers List"></a><del>Best Brokers List</del></h2><h2 id="Forex-Wiki-Green-EA-Strategy"><a href="#Forex-Wiki-Green-EA-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Forex Wiki Green EA Strategy"></a>Forex Wiki Green EA Strategy</h2><p>The EA deploys a strategy that places trades in alignment with the prevailing market trend, initiating orders only after a price correction has taken place. Should the price correction move counter to the market trend, the EA will activate its martingale strategy to expedite the attainment of the profit target.</p><p>Should the situation arise where an existing order has not achieved the profit target and there is a shift in the market trend, the EA will engage in hedging as a precautionary measure to safeguard the investment. Upon reaching the profit target for both purchase and sale orders, the EA will terminate all orders. Moreover, if all active orders incur a loss reaching up to 5% of the equity, the EA will close all orders to ensure the preservation of funds.
